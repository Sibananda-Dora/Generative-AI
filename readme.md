Welcome to my repository of codes created while exploring **Generative AI**, **LLMs**, and related technologies.  
These projects represent my personal learning journey — experimenting, building, and understanding how GenAI systems work.

## 📁 About This Repo

This repository includes:
- Sample code and experiments with various AI APIs and frameworks  
- Prompt engineering exercises  
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) prototypes  
- AI integration demos using Python and other tools  

Feel free to browse through the code, fork it, or learn from it!

## ⚠️ Note on API Keys

You might come across some API keys in the code.  
These keys have been **revoked** and are **non-functional**.  

> 🚫 Please do not attempt to use or reuse them — they no longer work.
If you’re trying to run the code yourself, replace any API key values with your own valid ones or use environment variables instead.
